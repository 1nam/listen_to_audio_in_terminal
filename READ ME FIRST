wav files have to be in the same folder as the script.

open terminal in folder/directory where the music and script is.

chmod +x s.sh   #makes script ececuteable.

./s.sh     #starts the script in terminal.

For wav you can use aplay

example in terminal type:    

aplay crickets.wav

aplay Rain.wav

aplay wind.wav


this plays the song till the end.

or

ctrl + c   to stop and return to terminal prompt.
